TUI FIXES APPLIED - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY
========================================

ISSUES RESOLVED:
===============

1. ❌ BEFORE: _progress_callback() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
   ✅ AFTER: Fixed to accept variable arguments (*args, **kwargs)

2. ❌ BEFORE: Error messages printed under TUI, breaking display
   ✅ AFTER: All messages now go to status panel with proper formatting

3. ❌ BEFORE: No visual distinction for error/warning/info messages  
   ✅ AFTER: Enhanced status panel with color-coded messages and icons

DETAILED CHANGES:
================

1. PROGRESS CALLBACK SIGNATURE FIX:
   - Changed from: def _progress_callback(self, message: str, progress: float = 0.0)
   - Changed to: def _progress_callback(self, *args, **kwargs)
   - Now handles any number of arguments flexibly

2. NEW STATUS UPDATE METHOD:
   - Added: _update_status(self, message: str, status_type: str = "info")
   - Routes all messages to status panel instead of print statements
   - Supports "info", "warning", "error" status types

3. ENHANCED ERROR HANDLING:
   - quit_application() now shows detailed cleanup progress
   - Individual manager cleanup errors are caught and displayed
   - Keyboard handler errors are handled gracefully

4. IMPROVED STATUS PANEL DISPLAY:
   - Error messages: ❌ with red styling and red border
   - Warning messages: ⚠️ with yellow styling and yellow border  
   - Info messages: ℹ️ with cyan styling
   - Panel border color changes based on message type

5. REDUCED PRINT STATEMENTS:
   - Main run loop now uses status updates
   - Only startup errors (before TUI init) still use print
   - Final shutdown message still uses print (TUI already closed)

VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS:
===================

Status Panel now shows:
✅ [INFO] Shutting down application...
✅ [INFO] Cleaning up connection_manager...  
✅ [INFO] Cleaning up database_ops...
❌ [ERROR] Error during database cleanup: RithmicAdminTUI._progress_callback() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
✅ [INFO] Keyboard handler stopped

With appropriate colors and border styling.

TESTING:
========
The specific error mentioned should now be resolved:
- "RithmicAdminTUI._progress_callback() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given"
- This will no longer occur due to the flexible signature

FILES MODIFIED:
==============
1. enhanced_admin_rithmic.py:
   - Fixed _progress_callback signature
   - Added _update_status method
   - Enhanced quit_application error handling
   - Updated main run loop error handling

2. admin_display_manager.py:
   - Enhanced render_status method
   - Added color-coded message display
   - Dynamic panel border styling

VERIFICATION:
============
To test the fixes:
1. Run: python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py
2. Try operations that might trigger cleanup
3. Check that error messages appear in status panel, not as print statements
4. Verify that status panel changes color based on message type

The callback signature error should be completely resolved.
