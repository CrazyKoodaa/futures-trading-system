## Starting the Application

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have a Python virtual environment set up
2. Activate the virtual environment before running any commands:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Make sure all dependencies are installed

### Using the Text User Interface (TUI)

The TUI provides an interactive interface for working with the Rithmic API.

1. Navigate to the enhanced_rithmic_admin directory:
   ```
   cd .\layer1_development\enhanced_rithmic_admin
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Run the application without arguments to start in interactive mode:
   ```
   python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py
   ```

4. Navigation in TUI mode:
   - Use arrow keys (↑/↓) or k/j to navigate menu items
   - Press Enter or Space to execute the selected operation
   - Use number keys (1-5) for direct menu selection
   - Press 0 to exit the application
   - Press q or Ctrl+C to quit immediately

5. Available operations in TUI mode:
   - Test Connections: Verify connectivity to Rithmic services
   - Search Symbols: Find and validate trading symbols
   - Download Historical Data: Retrieve historical market data
   - View Database Data: Examine stored market data
   - Initialize Database: Set up the database structure

### Using Command-Line Arguments

The application also supports command-line operation for automation and scripting.

1. Navigate to the enhanced_rithmic_admin directory:
   ```
   cd .\layer1_development\enhanced_rithmic_admin
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Available commands:

   - Show help and keyboard shortcuts:
     ```
     python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py --help-keys
     ```

   - Test connections:
     ```
     python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py test
     ```

   - Search for symbols:
     ```
     python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py search -s "NQ*"
     ```
     Options:
     - `-s, --symbol`: Symbol pattern to search for (supports wildcards)
     - `-e, --exchange`: Exchange name (default: CME)

   - Download historical data:
     ```
     python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py download -s NQM5 -d 7
     ```
     Options:
     - `-s, --symbol`: Symbol to download data for
     - `-e, --exchange`: Exchange name (default: CME)
     - `-d, --days`: Number of days of historical data to download (default: 7)

   - View database data:
     ```
     python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py view
     ```

   - Initialize database:
     ```
     python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py init
     ```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Setting up and downloading data for a specific contract

1. Start by initializing the database:
   ```
   python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py init
   ```

2. Test connections to ensure Rithmic services are available:
   ```
   python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py test
   ```

3. Search for a specific contract:
   ```
   python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py search -s "ESM5"
   ```

4. Download historical data for the contract:
   ```
   python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py download -s ESM5 -d 10
   ```

5. View the downloaded data:
   ```
   python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py view
   ```

### Example 2: Interactive workflow using TUI

1. Start the application in interactive mode:
   ```
   python enhanced_admin_rithmic.py
   ```

2. Use the menu to navigate through operations:
   - Select "Test Connections" to verify connectivity
   - Select "Initialize Database" to set up the database
   - Select "Search Symbols" to find contracts of interest
   - Select "Download Historical Data" to retrieve market data
   - Select "View Database Data" to examine the downloaded data

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

- If connection issues occur, verify network connectivity and Rithmic service status
- For database errors, check database connection settings and permissions
- Symbol search issues may be related to exchange availability or symbol format
- Historical data download problems could be due to data availability or rate limits

## Best Practices

1. Always activate the virtual environment before running commands
2. Test connections before attempting to download data
3. Initialize the database before storing any data
4. Use specific symbol patterns rather than broad wildcards for efficient searches
5. Download reasonable amounts of historical data (7-30 days) to avoid timeouts
6. Close the application properly to ensure connections are cleaned up
