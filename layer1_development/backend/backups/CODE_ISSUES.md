# Code Issues and Solutions

## Import Issues

After analyzing the codebase, several import-related issues were identified that need to be resolved for the application to function properly.

### 1. Inconsistent Module Names

**Issue**: In `admin_operations.py`, there's an import from `admin_core_classes`, but the actual file is named `admin_core_classes_.py` (with an underscore).

**Solution**: Either rename the file or update the import statement:

```python
# Change this:
from admin_core_classes import SystemStatus, DownloadProgress, ContractInfo

# To this:
from admin_core_classes_ import SystemStatus, DownloadProgress, ContractInfo
```

### 2. Class Name Mismatches

**Issue**: Several class names in import statements don't match the actual class names in the files:

1. In `admin_operations.py`, it imports `RithmicSymbolOperations`, but the class is actually named `RithmicSymbolManager` in `admin_rithmic_symbols.py`.
2. It imports `RithmicHistoricalOperations`, but the class is actually named `RithmicHistoricalManager` in `admin_rithmic_historical.py`.
3. It imports `RithmicOperations`, but the class is actually named `RithmicOperationsManager` in `admin_rithmic_operations.py`.

**Solution**: Update the import statements to match the actual class names:

```python
# Change these:
from admin_rithmic_symbols import RithmicSymbolOperations  
from admin_rithmic_historical import RithmicHistoricalOperations
from admin_rithmic_operations import RithmicOperations

# To these:
from admin_rithmic_symbols import RithmicSymbolManager  
from admin_rithmic_historical import RithmicHistoricalManager
from admin_rithmic_operations import RithmicOperationsManager
```

### 3. Missing Module

**Issue**: The code imports from `shared.database.connection`, but this module doesn't exist in the project.

**Solution**: Either create this module or update the import to use an existing database connection module. Based on the project structure, it appears that `admin_database.py` might contain the necessary database connection functionality.

```python
# Change this:
from shared.database.connection import get_async_session, TimescaleDBHelper

# To something like this (depending on what's available in admin_database.py):
from admin_database import get_async_session, TimescaleDBHelper
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Fix the import in `admin_operations.py` to use the correct module name (`admin_core_classes_` instead of `admin_core_classes`).
2. Update the class names in the imports to match the actual class names.
3. Either create the missing `shared.database.connection` module or update the import to use an existing module.
4. Test the application to ensure all imports are working correctly.

## Additional Recommendations

1. Standardize naming conventions across the project (e.g., decide whether to use underscores in file names or not).
2. Consider using relative imports for better maintainability.
3. Add docstrings to modules to clarify their purpose and dependencies.
4. Implement proper error handling for import errors to provide more helpful error messages.
5. Consider using a dependency injection pattern to make the code more testable and reduce tight coupling between modules.
